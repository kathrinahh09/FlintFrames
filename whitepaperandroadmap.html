        <h1>Holder Benefits for FLINTFRAMES</h1>
        <p>As a valued holder of our exclusive NFT art, you unlock a world of rewards and privileges. Each NFT in your collection comes with a score rating, and the more NFTs you hold, the higher your total score rating, enhancing your chances of reaping incredible benefits. Here’s what you can expect:</p>

        <h2>1. Reward Tiers Based on Total Score Rating</h2>
        <p>Holders are ranked based on their total score rating, calculated by summing the score of all NFTs in their wallet.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Top-Tier Rewards:</strong> The highest-ranking holder will receive the grand prize, which could include exclusive NFTs, merchandise, or high-value rewards.</li>
            <li><strong>Tiered Rewards:</strong> Rewards are distributed across different ranks, ensuring benefits for multiple holders, not just the top spot.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Exclusive Airdrops</h2>
        <p>The higher your total score rating, the higher your chances of receiving exclusive NFT airdrops that are not available for sale.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Airdrops may include rare, limited-edition NFTs as well as tokens that can be used within the project ecosystem or traded.</li>
            <li>These tokens provide added utility and engagement opportunities within the community.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Revenue Sharing Opportunities</h2>
        <p>As a way to give back to our most loyal supporters, top holders may receive a share of the project's royalty earnings or a percentage of proceeds from future collections.</p>

        <h2>4. Priority in Future Drops</h2>
        <p>The higher your score, the better your position in the whitelist or early access for future NFT collections, ensuring you can expand your collection before others.</p>

        <h2>5. Community Influence</h2>
        <p>Top-rated holders will have a voice in shaping the future of the project through voting rights on major decisions like new themes, collaborations, or utility expansions.</p>

        <h2>The Key to Success:</h2>
        <p>Collect and hold as many NFTs as possible to boost your total score rating.</p>
        <p>Remember, quality matters too—NFTs with higher individual scores can significantly impact your total score.</p>
        <p>Start building your collection and aim for the top of the leaderboard. The rewards await!</p>
